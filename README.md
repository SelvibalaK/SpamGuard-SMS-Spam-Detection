# SpamGuard üì±üõ°Ô∏è

Welcome to the SpamGuard repository!

## About
This repository houses a machine learning project developed during an internship at Codeway Solutions. The project aims to combat SMS spam through the implementation of logistic regression and TF-IDF vectorization techniques. SpamGuard empowers users to safeguard their communication channels by accurately identifying and filtering out spam messages.

## Project Highlights:
- **Spam Detection:** Utilizes logistic regression model trained on SMS data to classify messages as spam or ham.
- **TF-IDF Vectorization:** Converts text data into numerical features for improved model performance.
- **Data Source:** Utilizes the "spam.csv" dataset for training and testing the model.
- **Internship Experience:** Developed during an internship at Codeway Solutions, providing practical experience in machine learning and natural language processing.
- **Tool Used:** Data analysis and model training were conducted using Spyder.

## Usage:
Explore the SpamGuard repository to access code, documentation, and datasets related to SMS spam detection. The project includes comprehensive instructions on how to utilize the model effectively and replicate the results.

## Directory Structure:
- **data:** Contains datasets used for model training and testing.
- **scripts:** Python scripts for data preprocessing and model evaluation.
- **models:** Serialized model files for deployment.
- **spyder_projects:** Spyder IDE project files and analysis scripts.
